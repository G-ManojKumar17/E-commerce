# Angular E-commerce Application | WEB APPLICATION
This is a **frontend-driven web application** built using **Angular, Bootstrap, and JSON Server** (with `db.json`). The project showcases my ability to develop a **full-fledged frontend system** integrated with a **mock backend**, including **product management, cart functionality, and dynamic routing**. It follows a **modular and scalable architecture**, ensuring maintainability and smooth performance.

### **ðŸš€ Key Features:**  
âœ… **Product Listing** â€“ Displayed dynamic products fetched from the **mock API (db.json)** with options to filter and sort.  
âœ… **Shopping Cart** â€“ Implemented a fully functional **shopping cart system**, allowing users to add, update, and remove products.  
âœ… **Mock Authentication** â€“ Built a **simulated login flow** to demonstrate user authentication logic.  
âœ… **Routing System** â€“ Used **Angular Router** to manage page navigation seamlessly between home, product, cart, and login pages.  
âœ… **CRUD Operations with JSON Server** â€“ Simulated real-world CRUD operations using **JSON Server** and **HTTP Client module** in Angular.  
âœ… **Responsive Design** â€“ Crafted a **responsive and mobile-friendly layout** using **Bootstrap** and **Angular Material**.  
âœ… **Form Handling & Validation** â€“ Processed user forms with **built-in validation mechanisms** using **Reactive Forms**.  
âœ… **Error Handling** â€“ Implemented proper **API error handling** for better user experience and application stability.  
âœ… **UI Enhancements** â€“ Used **Angular Material components** and **SweetAlert** for better user interaction and interface feedback.
